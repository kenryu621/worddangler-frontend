# How to contribute

- When you start working on the repo don't contribute to the main branch directly. Instead create a fork, work on your own fork, and open a Pull Requests when you are ready to contribute code.
- All Pull Requests require approval from another person in the dev team. You have been added to the dev team if you already joined the org
- All Pull Requests have been set to automatically run continuous integration / continuous development workflows. So when you create a Pull Requests, your code will automatically be tested for linting issues and logic issues that have implemented tests.

Here is an example of a run: https://github.com/worddangler/frontend/actions/runs/4466216267

# Tools used

- We are using Jest for tests: https://jestjs.io/
- We are using eslint for linting: https://eslint.org/
- We are using prettier for formatting: https://prettier.io/
- We are using react for frontend: https://react.dev/

# Setting up your development environment

- You can use any editor / ide.
- Install the prettier plugin for your editor and set it up to auto-fix your code on save. Note that prettier formatting is enforced, so if your code is not formatted to follow prettier rules, you will get linting errors when you make a pr.
